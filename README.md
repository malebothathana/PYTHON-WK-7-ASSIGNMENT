# PYTHON-WK-7-ASSIGNMENT# 📖 README — Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

## 📚 Project Summary
In this project, I analyzed and visualized a **simulated sales dataset** using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

---

## 🛠️ Steps Completed

### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- Imported libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `warnings`).
- Created a simulated sales dataset with columns: `Date`, `Product`, `Region`, `Units Sold`, and `Revenue`.
- Displayed the first rows with `head()`.
- Checked data types and missing values (none found).

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Calculated basic statistics with `describe()`.
- Grouped by `Product` to find the average revenue.
- Noted that Laptops generated the highest average revenue.

### Task 3: Data Visualization
- **Line Chart**: Revenue trend over time.
- **Bar Chart**: Average revenue by product.
- **Histogram**: Distribution of units sold.
- **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between units sold and revenue, colored by region.
- Added titles, labels, grids, and legends for clarity.

### 🎯 Bonus: Error Handling
- Demonstrated simple error handling for missing file loading with `try-except`.

## 🧠 Key Observations
- Laptops have the highest revenue overall.
- Revenue shows natural daily fluctuations.
- Positive correlation between units sold and revenue.
- Regional differences are visible in scatter plots.

---

## 🧰 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

# ✅ Conclusion
I successfully completed the full workflow: loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data with a clear structure and error handling.
